## Prerequisites
Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (Check with `node --version`)
- npm (Check with `npm --version`) 
- Git
- A GitLab account

### Part 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. First, let's verify our development environment. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```
   If either command fails, you'll need to install Node.js and npm first.

2. Install the Gatsby CLI tool globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   ```
   
   ðŸš¨ Common Issues:
   - If you get a permission error on Unix-like systems, you may need to use `sudo`

### Part 2: Creating "manually" Your Static Website

1. Create a new Gatsby website using the default starter:
   ```bash
   gatsby new static-website
   cd static-website
   ```
   
2. Start the development server to verify your site works:
   ```bash
   gatsby develop
   ```
   
   This will start a development server at `http://localhost:8000`. Open your browser and navigate to this address.

   âœ¨ Success Check:
   - You should see the default Gatsby starter page
   - The page should have a header, some text, and links
   
   ðŸš¨ Common Issues:
   - If port 8000 is already in use, Gatsby will suggest an alternative port

### Part 3: Setting up Your GitLab Repository 

1. Log into GitLab and create a new project:
   - Click "New project"
   - Name it "my-static-website"
   - **Do not initialize the project with README file** 

2. Connect your Gatsby repository to GitLab

### Part 4: Creating "manually" a Production Build

1. Now that we have our development site working, let's create a production-ready build:
   ```bash
   gatsby build
   ```

   âœ¨ Success Check:
   - You should see messages about:
     - Building production JavaScript and CSS bundles
     - Generating static HTML pages
   - A new `public` directory should be created
   
2. Inspect the production build:
   ```bash
   cd public
   ls
   ```
   
   You should see:
   - An `index.html` file
   - JavaScript files
   - Other assets needed for the website

   ðŸ’¡ Understanding the Output:
   - The `public` directory contains your complete production-ready website
   - Everything is optimized and minimized for production use
   - These are the files that will actually be deployed to your web server
   - This is your build "artifact" - the output of your build process
