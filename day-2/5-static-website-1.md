### Prerequisites
Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (Check with `node --version`)
- npm (Check with `npm --version`) 
- Git
- A GitLab.com account

### Part 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. First, let's verify our development environment. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```
   If either command fails, you'll need to install Node.js and npm first.

2. Install the Gatsby CLI tool globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   ```
   
   ðŸš¨ Common Issues:
   - If you get a permission error on Unix-like systems, you may need to use `sudo`
Great! Let me continue with the next section about creating the static website:

### Part 2: Creating Your Static Website

1. Create a new Gatsby website using the default starter:
   ```bash
   gatsby new static-website
   cd static-website
   ```
   
2. Start the development server to verify your site works:
   ```bash
   gatsby develop
   ```
   
   This will start a development server at `http://localhost:8000`. Open your browser and navigate to this address.

   âœ¨ Success Check:
   - You should see the default Gatsby starter page
   - The page should have a header, some text, and links
   
   ðŸš¨ Common Issues:
   - If port 8000 is already in use, Gatsby will suggest an alternative port

### Part 3: Setting up Your GitLab Repository

1. Log into GitLab.com and create a new project:
   - Click "New project"
   - Name it "my-static-website"

2. Connect your local repository to GitLab

### Part 4: Creating a Production Build

1. Now that we have our development site working, let's create a production-ready build:
   ```bash
   gatsby build
   ```

   âœ¨ Success Check:
   - You should see messages about:
     - Building production JavaScript and CSS bundles
     - Generating static HTML pages
   - A new `public` directory should be created
   
2. Inspect the production build:
   ```bash
   cd public
   ls
   ```
   
   You should see:
   - An `index.html` file
   - JavaScript files
   - Other assets needed for the website

   ðŸ’¡ Understanding the Output:
   - The `public` directory contains your complete production-ready website
   - Everything is optimized and minimized for production use
   - These are the files that will actually be deployed to your web server
   - This is your build "artifact" - the output of your build process

### Part 5: Introduction to Docker for CI/CD

Docker will be important for our CI/CD process because:

1. It provides isolated environments for building and testing
2. Ensures consistency between development and CI environments
3. Allows using specific versions of Node.js and other tools without conflicts

We'll be using Docker in our GitLab CI pipeline to:
- Create a consistent build environment
- Ensure our build process works the same way everywhere
- Package our application with all its dependencies
