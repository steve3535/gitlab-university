* u wanna see whats gonna be committed ? (like a commit preview): `git commit`
* u wanna check the ignored files being taken into account ? `git status --ignored`
* u are not in a specific repo but still want to check something overthere without changing directory ? `git -C /path/to/another/repo status`
