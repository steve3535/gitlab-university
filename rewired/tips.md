* u wanna see whats gonna be committed ? (like a commit preview): `git commit`
* u wanna check the ignored files being taken into account ? `git status --ignored`
* u are not in a specific repo but still want to check something overthere without changing directory ? `git -C /path/to/another/repo status`
* How to ignore .gitignore ? i.e have a local .gitignore and keep unchanged the shared one from upstream
  * Option 1: use the file *.git/info/exclude*
  * Option 2: put exceptions for tracking: `git update-index --assume-unchanged /path/to/file`
  * Option 3: skip the worktree for a specific file: `git update-index --skip-worktree /path/to/file`

  **.gitignore** is the classic solution
  there are even generators for it (not only in IDEs but remember also this site => gitigniore.io -- from my old friend of toptal)  
  the issue with .gitignore is that is ahred with the team, so its part of the commits and needs to be shipped upstream  
  what happens if you want to ignore some very specific local files but that are only peculliar to you ... very easy situation to happen, ha !

  **.git/info/exclude**
  >it can help skip tracking things without using .gitignore, so apparently solving the above issue.
  but thereis a trap ...
  > remember in git the distinction between tracked and changed: u can have something tracked but that is changing or not: track is the very first step to put something unde rthe control of git

  And here is the issue with the exclude file: it will only skip files that are untracked.  
  lesson of this is that u should create this file ahead of your files, for it to work !  

  **git update-index --assume-unchanged /path/to/file**

  A good way of illustrating this is whith: `git ls-files -v`  
  **H** is high priority tracking  
  **h** is low priority tracking  
  **S** is for skipping  

  **git update-index --skip-worktree /path/to/file**

* jai remark√© qqchz detrange avec codepsaces. impossible den lancer ou den ouvrir en fenetre incognito sous un autre compte. (firefox)
  finalement, le workflow: commencer par ouvrir le codespace avec letudiant beta dans la fenetre incognito avant de se connecter en tant que steve3535 dans la fenetre main
