## Git's Mental Model

### The Three States
1. **Working Directory**
   - Your actual files
   - Where you make changes

2. **Staging Area (Index)**
   - Preparation room
   - Choose what to commit

3. **Repository**
   - History storage
   - Permanent records

Visual Metaphor: "Photography Studio"
- Working Directory = Scene you're photographing
- Staging Area = Setting up the shot
- Repository = Photo album

## Quick Setup Verification

### Command Line Check
```bash
# Check Git installation
git --version

# Verify configuration
git config --get user.name
git config --get user.email

# Test GitHub connection
ssh -T git@github.com
```
